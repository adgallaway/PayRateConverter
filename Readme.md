# Pay Rate Converter
    Pay Rate Converter (PRC) will convert pay rates to another rate
    Supported rates to convert to and from are:
        Hourly
        Weekly
        Biweekly
        Semi-Monthly
        Monthly
        Annually

    This will help you if you are applying for credit or a loan and 
    are paid hourly, but the credit/load application is asking for
    your annual or monthly pay. Just enter your wage, select which
    rate you would like to convert it from, then the rate you would
    like to convert it to, and press continue. Instead of you having
    to wonder if you made an error, Pay Rate Converter does the math
    for you.

    We currently only support conversions considering a 40 hour, 5 day
    work week, however, we do plan to allow that to be changed by the
    user. We also plan to add after estimated tax totals as well. The
    estimated tax rates will be user configurable, along with the hours
    per day, and days per week.
