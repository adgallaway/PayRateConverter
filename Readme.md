# Pay Rate Converter
    Pay Rate Converter (PRC) will convert pay rates to another rate
    Supported rates to convert to and from are:
        Hourly
        Weekly
        Biweekly
        Semi-Monthly
        Monthly
        Annually

    This will help you if you are applying for credit or a loan and 
    are paid hourly, but the credit/load application is asking for
    your annual or monthly pay. Just enter your wage, select which
    rate you would like to convert it from, then the rate you would
    like to convert it to, and press continue. Instead of you having
    to wonder if you made an error, Pay Rate Converter does the math
    for you.

    There is built in support for users to configure their work week,
    as well as their own estimated tax rate. Found in the Settings menu,
    the user will be able to view the current settings, as well as change
    them.

    We currently do not support calculations for overtime. All overtime
    hours will be calculated as straight time, instead of time and a half.
